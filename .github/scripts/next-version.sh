#   <type>!: / BREAKING CHANGE: in the body    -> major
#   feat:                                      -> minor
#   fix: perf: build: refactor: chore(deps):   -> patch
#   docs: test: chore: ci: style:              -> none
# The highest bump in the range wins. "[skip release]" in a subject, or alone on
# its own line, forces none.
#
# Only the subject carries the type, per the conventional-commits spec. Bodies are
# scanned solely for BREAKING CHANGE: and [skip release] -- a body that merely
# discusses "feat:" or "fix:" must not trigger a release, which is why commits are
# parsed as NUL-separated records rather than as a flat stream of lines.
#
# On a prerelease base (vX.Y.Z-rcN or vX.Y.Z-rc.N) any non-none bump only advances
# the rc counter and normalises it to the dotted form: the semver triple is frozen
# until GA is tagged by hand. The dot matters -- "rcN" is a single alphanumeric
# identifier compared as a string, so rc10 would sort BELOW rc9, whereas the dotted
# form is a numeric identifier and increments correctly without bound.
#
# Env overrides, used by next-version_test.sh:
#   LATEST_TAG           base tag, instead of `git describe`. Unless
#                        COMMIT_MESSAGES_FILE is also set, the tag must exist:
#                        the commit range is still `$LATEST_TAG..HEAD`.
#   COMMIT_MESSAGES_FILE file of NUL-separated commit messages, instead of `git log`
#                        (as produced by `git log -z --format=%B`)
